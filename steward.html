    <br><br>1. Secure .eth TLD
    <br><br>
    Create a task force with the express purpose of establishing a formal partnership with the necessary parties (government of Ethiopia, ICANN, IANA) to negotiate obtaining rights to manage or operate the .eth TLD.
    <br><br>
    This task force should report progress updates two times per month for inclusion in the ENS DAO Newsletter on the 1st and 15th.
    <br><br><br>
    2. Second Airdrop
    <br><br>
    Every wallet that held at least one .eth name throughout the entire period of 1 November 2021 - 31 December 2022 is eligible to claim 1 $ENS token.
   <br><br> Addresses that are set as a primary name are eligible to claim an additional 1 $ENS.
    <br><br>The original airdrop interface and mechanism should be able to be repurposed to facilitate this at claim.ens.domains
    <br><br>
    This can also be used as an opportunity to push for redelegation.
    <br><br><br>
    3. Quadratic Voting
    <br><br>
    Weight delegates $ENS vote based on the square root of their voting power. Voting power in this context refers to the the total amount of $ENS delegated to an individual plus the amount of $ENS held in their wallet.
    <br><br>
    weighted vote = square root($ENS in wallet + delegated votes)
    <br><br>
    A delegate with a voting power of 1 has 1 weighted vote.<br>
    A delegate with a voting power of 4 has 2 weighted votes.<br>
    A delegate with a voting power of 9 has 3 weighted votes.<br>
    and so on
    <br><br>
    This gives more voice to community members with smaller amounts of $ENS in their wallets (or delegated to them), ensuring that proposals supported by many individual community members are not overlooked in favor of those supported by a few.
    <br><br>
    This also exponentially decreases the effectiveness of simply buying more votes.
    <br><br><br>
    4. Reconsider Delegation Process<br><br>
    Consider implementing an expiration framework for votes delegated to inactive delegates. 
    <br><br>For much the same reasons that ownership of .eth names should not be permanent, the same logic should apply to delegation.
    <br><br><hr>
    <i>This list is a work and progress and is subject to change. It will continue to be updated and refined.</i><br><br>

If you would like to delegate your $ENS to me to vote on your behalf, you can do so on my <a href="https://agora.ensdao.org/delegate/daylon.eth"><i>ENS Agora</i></a>. 
    <br><br>A full record of my past votes is also available to view. I intend to continue to participate in 100% of the votes, both on chain and off.
